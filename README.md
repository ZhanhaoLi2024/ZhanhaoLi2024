## Hi there 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZhanhaoLi2024
- 👀 I’m interested in taking solo walks around the city, snapping photos with vintage rangefinder cameras from the ’70s and ’80s. When I’m not out exploring, I’m diving into web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go in my spare time while taking graduate courses. I’m almost graduating, but still haven’t found a job yet, which makes me pretty anxious every day. T^T
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to CHI (Computer-Human Interaction). I’ve noticed that some of my friends have really unique insights into design, and I think it would be amazing to collaborate with them on an interesting project that combines both design and technology.
- 📫 If you’re a classmate, feel free to reach me at li.zhanh@northeastern.edu. If not, you can contact me at lizhanhao2024@gmail.com. Haha, no matter who you are, you’re all important friends to me!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have this habit of sneaking little fun notes into my code comments, like my current favorite song! Lately, I’ve been obsessed with Not Angry, and I actually hid it in the comments of my latest project. If you find it, I hope the song can bring you some calm during those frustrating coding moments—just like it does for me! (*^__^*)
